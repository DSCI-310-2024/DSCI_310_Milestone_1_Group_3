# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for
learning and contributing.  All members of our group are expected 
to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in DSCI 310 Group 3 activities are required to conform to the Code of Conduct.  This Code of Conduct applies to
all spaces managed by DSCI 310 including, but not limited to, Group meetings,
email communication, and online forums such as Discord and GitHub. The DSCI 310
teaching team are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of
Conduct.

The DSCI 310 Instructor(s) is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.
All reports will be reviewed by the Instructor(s) and will be kept
confidential.

## The DSCI 310 Group 3 Code of Conduct
We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive
environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we
do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or members or
that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate
discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not
limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social
origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information,
religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority,
property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and
experience level.

Everyone who participates in DSCI 310 Group 3 activities is required to conform to this
Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by DSCI 310 including, but
not limited to, group meetings, email communication, and online forums such as
Discord and GitHub. The DSCI 310 teaching team are expected to assist with the
enforcement of the Code of Conduct. 

### Expected Behaviour

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect
and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of
platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and
professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of
behaviours in all DSCI 310 Group 3 events and platforms:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community and group
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community and group members
- Complete designated tasks by the time appointed or inform the group of any delays
- Reply to online conversations within 48 hours 
- Regularly attend group meetings

### Unacceptable Behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any DSCI 310 Group 3 event/platform include:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent
- Plagiarism of any sort

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Participants who don't meet task expectations or minor Code of conduct infractions will called in for a group meeting. Group members will work together to sort the problem first. If the problem persists, the instructor will be contacted and asked to intervene.

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to
comply immediately. This applies to any DSCI 310 Group 3 events and platforms, either
online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this
code of conduct, the teaching team may warn the offender and or engage the DSCI
310 Instructor to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose
appropriate sanctions.

### Incident Reporting Guidelines

If someone violates the Code of Conduct during a DSCI 310 Group 3 event or in an online
space outside of organized events, we ask that you report it to the
Instructor(s). The current instructor(s) of DSCI310 is(are) Tiffany Timbers. An
email message to the email address listed in the course syllabus will be seen by each respective instructor. To report a DSCI
310 code of conduct violation that will not be seen by your instructor, an
alternative contact person is Bruce Dunham, Professor of Teaching in the
Department of Statistics at UBC. His email is b.dunham[-at-]stat.ubc.ca.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
