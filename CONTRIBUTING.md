## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an Issue.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## How To Contribute Code to DSCI 310 Group 3

### Setting Up Your Environment

Fork the DSCI 310 Group 3 repository on GitHub and then clone the fork to you local
machine. For more details on forking see the [GitHub
Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).

To keep your fork up to date with changes in this repo,
you can [use the fetch upstream button on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).


### Creating a Branch

Once your local environment is up-to-date, you can create a new git branch
which will contain your contribution
(always create a new branch instead of making changes to the main branch):

```cmd
git switch -c <your-branch-name>
```

With this branch checked-out, make the desired changes to the package.

### Creating a Pull Request

When you are happy with your changes, you can commit them to your branch by running

```cmd
git add <modified-file>
git commit -m "Some descriptive message about your change"
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You will then need to submit a pull request (PR) on GitHub asking to merge
your example branch into the main DSCI 310 Group 3 repository. For details on creating a PR see GitHub
documentation [Creating a pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Some additional notes:
- You can add more details about your example in the PR such as motivation for the
example or why you thought it would be a good addition.  You will get feed back
in the PR discussion if anything needs to be changed. To make changes continue
to push commits made in your local example branch to origin and they will be
automatically shown in the PR. 

- Hopefully your PR will be answered in a timely manner and your contribution will
help others in the future.

- The format and style of new contributions should generally match that of existing examples.
